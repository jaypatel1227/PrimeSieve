This is a simple project to see how closely I can get python to perform with c++ code. 
I wasn't trying that hard, but knowing that for large numbers, the python takes only about 50% more time, I am reasonably satisfied.
With numba or some other careful code optimization, it is quite plausible that both pieces of code would perform about the same.
